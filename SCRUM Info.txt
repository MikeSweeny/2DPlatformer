Day 1:

-Add a blueprint that moves a platform up/down or left/right.
-Add a blueprint that makes a platform rotate at a continuous rate, or rotates periodically with pauses.
-Add a level blueprint that displays the time on screen.
-Add a blueprint that teleports the player when touched to another teleporter. A Boolean lets you use them to teleport back.
-Add a blueprint that gives the player a point when touched and then removes itself.


Day 2:

Add a unique texture atlas of static objects/terrain/etc.
Create three or more sprite objects that pull from that atlas.
Find and add a player character sprite of your choosing whose atlas comes with suitable animations for what might be needed in the future for your game. Display a single sprite image for now.
Add assets for two enemies with different locomotion types. (i.e. walker, hopper, flyer, floater, etc.) That will move in the future.
Layout a themed level, using some of yesterdayâ€™s blueprints.
